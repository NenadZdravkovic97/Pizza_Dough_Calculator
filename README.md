# Pizza_Dough_Calculator
This is my first project, it is a website that explains how to make Neapolitan-style pizza, it has a built-in calculator where you put the number of pizzas that you want, the weight of a single dough ball, and water percent,then you get the recipe to follow with the exact amount of the ingredients that you need.
