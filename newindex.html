                            What exactly is Neapolitan Pizza?
                        </h1>
                        <p>
                            Neapolitan pizza, or pizza Napoletana, is a type of
                            pizza that originated in Naples, Italy. This style
                            of pizza is prepared with simple and fresh
                            ingredients: a basic dough, raw tomatoes, fresh
                            mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and olive oil. No
                            fancy toppings are allowed!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of its defining characteristics is that there is
                            often more sauce than cheese. This leaves the middle
                            of the pie wet or soggy and not conducive to being
                            served by the slice. Because of this, Neapolitan
                            pizzas are generally pretty small (about 10 to 12
                            inches), making them closer to the size of a
                            personal pizza.

                        <p>
                            Neapolitan pizzas are also cooked at very high
                            temperatures (800 F to 900 F) for no more than 90
                            seconds.

                        <p>
                            Pizza as we know it today (dough topped with
                            tomatoes and cheese) was invented in Naples. Before
                            the 1700s, flatbreads existed but were never topped
                            with tomatoes, which is now a defining
                            characteristic of pizza.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Baker Raffaele Esposito, who worked at the Naples
                            pizzeria “Pietro... e basta così,” is generally
                            credited with creating Margherita pizza. In 1889,
                            King Umberto I and Queen Margherita of Savoy visited
                            Naples. Esposito baked them a pizza named in honor
                            of the queen whose colors mirrored those of the
                            Italian flag: red (tomatoes), white (mozzarella),
                            and green (basil leaves). This is what is now known
                            as the classic Neapolitan pizza today.

                        <p>
                            The official requirements of an authentic Neapolitan
                            pizza begin with the crust. The dough must be made
                            with highly refined Italian type 0 or 00 wheat
                            flour, Neapolitan or fresh brewer’s yeast (not dry
                            yeast), water, and salt. It must be kneaded by hand
                            or with a low-speed mixer and formed by hand,
                            without the help of a rolling pin.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The dough is topped with raw, pureed San Marzano
                            tomatoes from Italy. It can use only two types of
                            mozzarella cheese. One is fior di latte made from
                            cow’s milk and the other is mozzarella di Bufala,
                            made from water buffalo milk, typically raised in
                            the Campania and Lazio marshlands in Italy. Finally,
                            Neapolitan pizza is topped off with fresh basil and
                            extra-virgin olive oil. The ingredients must be
                            all-natural and fresh.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The pizza is baked for 60 to 90 seconds (baking time
                            cannot exceed 90 seconds) in a minimum 800 F stone
                            oven with a wood fire.
